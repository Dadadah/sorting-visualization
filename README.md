# Sorting Visualization

## Purpose
  This project's purpose was to help me understand how to implement sorting algorithms and how
  sorting algorithms handle data in real time.
  
  This project was also featured at the Will Rogers Elementary STEM fair on February 24th, 2017

## Features
  This project features many sorts including:
  - Bubble sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
  - Gnome sort
  - Shell sort
  - Merge sort
  - Radix sort (MSD and LSD)
    
  Later I plan to implement more sorts like Quick sort and Binary sort.
  
  You are able to change the speed at which the sorts operate as well as the size of the data set.

### Usage at the STEM fair
  This visualizer was used to excite young students about computer science by showing them great
  things you can do with code. The program was given 13 data points, and told to sort it in a very
  slow manner. The children would then race against it with one suit of playing cards.
